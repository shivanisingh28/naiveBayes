# naiveBayes
Write a program to implement the Naïve Bayes Algorithm (m-estimate version) for a binary classification problem. The program will take two inputs: a training dataset and a test dataset. The value of m will be the number of possible values of a feature. All features will be categorical in the dataset. The last column of the datasets will be the class variable. Rename the two class values as: positive and negative. Your program will first load the training dataset, calculate all required probabilities, and then predict the class of each instance in the test set. The program will add a new column containing predicted classes to the test dataset and save it as predictions.csv. The program will also show the accuracy, sensitivity and specificity on the console. No libraries are used for naïve Bayes algorithm or performance calculation.
